    /// You are given two intervals, where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2). The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end) includes both start and end. For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end. Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two  intervals is a prime number.
